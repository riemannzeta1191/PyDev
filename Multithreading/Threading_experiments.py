#
# Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS
#     sleep((int)secs);      A thread can bypass the GIL by releasing it when it enters a I/O blocking
# Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS       instruction,during which other threads can run in parallel untill is asks
#                            back the GIL.Cpython interpreter only allows a thread at a time not the memory
#                            which can spawn n number of threads using the os-kernel.But spawning itself
#                            is a memory consuming process and thus multithreading is a performance degenerating
#                            feature in python.In contrast to the performance GIL protects the shared resources
#                            to not vanish into aether as it hinders threads to decrease the ref count of the
#                            shared object to not become 0 ,which in turn would lead to the garbage allocation of
#                            the object called by the interpreter using __del__ built_in method.GIL primarily
#                            helps in memory management within the call stack and the objects in the heap.Ideally
#                            it's not a feature for the end user's routine use.
